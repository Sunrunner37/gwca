#summary Documentation of all GWCA commands

This page contains documentation of all of the GWCA commands and how they are interacted with.

=How-to use=
First of all, to use GWCA you must inject the .Dll into Guild Wars. This can be done by either renaming the .Dll to 'Graphics.dll' without the quotes, or by using a Dll Injector application (search google).

Communication between GWCA and your script is performed using Window Messages, and therefore, your script must have a valid Window hwnd to retrieve information.

In AutoIt3, simply look at some of the scripts in the Source section to get an idea of how it is done. Remember also to 'register' the necessary custom messages for your GUI using 'GUIRegisterMsg(identifier, functionname)'.

You can register up to 3 different messages with GWCA:
*The WndCallback 0x500: This is used for all general input/output commands, pretty much a requirement to register this message to use GWCA.
*The SkillLogCallback 0x4A: This uses the WM_COPYDATA message to send a structure from GWCA which contains information about skills being cast.
*The SkillCancelCallback 0x501: Which is commonly used with the SkillLogCallback if you wish to track which skills are cancelled/interrupted aswell.

For instruction on how to use these 'Callbacks' please have a look at some of the example scripts in Source section.

=List of Commands=
The commands follow a distinct identifier pattern because they are a custom enumeration. To use them in AutoIt3, this enumeration has been pre-declared in 'GWCAConstants.au3' so you don't have to remember all the numbers though.

#CA_GETCURRENTTARGET (0x401): No parameters, returns an integer with the id of the current target.
#CA_GETMYID (0x402): No parameters, returns an integer with the id of your own agent.
#CA_CASTING (0x403): No parameters, returns a boolean which tells whether or not you're using a skill.
#CA_SKILLRECHARGE (0x403): Parameter = skillslot, returns an integer which is either a timestamp if the skill is recharging, or 0 if it's recharged.
#CA_SKILLADRENALINE (0x404): Parameter = skillslot, returns an integer telling how many points of adrenaline the specified skill has.
#CA_STOREVAR (0x405): Obsolete, so don't use it.
#CA_SETLOGANDHWND (0x406): Parameter = boolean to enable skill log, parameter 2 = hwnd of your script's window.
#CA_GETAGENTANDTARGETPTR (0x407): No parameters, used for debugging purposes.
#CA_GETSKILLBARSKILLID (0x408): Parameter = skillslot, obsolete.
#CA_GETMYMAXHP (0x409): No parameters, returns an integer with your max hp and an integer with your current hp.
#CA_GETMYMAXENERGY (0x40A): No parameters, returns an integer with your max energy and an integer with your current energy.
#CA_GETBUILDNUMBER (0x40B): No parameters, returns an integer with the current build number of the GW client you're running.
#CA_CHANGEMAXZOOM (0x40C): Parameter = integer with zoom value, changes your max zoom. Default is 750, default for observer mode is 1400.

#CA_ATTACK (0x410): Parameter = id of target, attacks the specified target with weapon.
#CA_MOVE (0x411): Parameters = X and Y coords of location to move to, remember to pack the float values (or simply use MoveEx()) when using this command.
#CA_USESKILL (0x412): Obsolete, use CA_USESKILLBARSKILL instead.
#CA_CHANGEWEAPONSET (0x413): Parameter = weapon slot, changes weapon set.
